Chrome "hosted app" manifest - for a large icon on your Chrome start page

I am almost too lazy to dig out the bookmark to the SAPUI5 content area on the SAP Community Network,
so I created a small hosted app manifest for Chrome. Now I have a big icon on my Chrome start page. Nice!

Clone this repo somewhere, and then load it into Chrome by going into the Extensions, checking the Developer mode,
and choosing "Load unpacked extension", pointing it at the new folder that was just created by the git clone.
